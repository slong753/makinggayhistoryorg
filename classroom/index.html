            <b>C</b>oncepts) Inquiry
            Kit explores the use and effectiveness of nonviolent and nonverbal protest through analysis of a 1983 LGBT
            rights incident and subsequent court case involving Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rólon. Their story, which
            frames discriminatory policies and practices related to sexual orientation and gender within the broader
            Civil Rights Movement, is brought to life through archival audio oral history testimony from the Give Voice
            to History Project, produced in partnership with the Making Gay History podcast.

            The “We the People” CIVIC Inquiry Kit expands the American Civil Rights Movement to include Gay Rights and
            the LGBT
            movement. It brings this story to life through archival audio oral history testimony from the Give Voice to
            History
            Project, which is produced in partnership with the Making Gay History podcast. In their own voices,
            trailblazers of
            the LGBT civil rights movement, including Perry Watkins, Morty Manford, Sylvia Rivera, and Ellen DeGeneres,
            explain
            how discriminatory laws, policies, and cultural practices led them to intentional or incidental activism.
