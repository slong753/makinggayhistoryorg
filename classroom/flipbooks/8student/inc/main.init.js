Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Part I: The Incident Background Information On January 13, 1983, Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n, two LGBT civil rights activists, went to Papa Choux, a restaurant in Los Angeles, for a romantic dinner. Little did they know that their desire to dine in one of Papa Choux\u2019s six booths would lead to a landmark civil rights case. After being seated at the table they had reserved, they were told that they needed to move from the semi-private booth because they were a lesbian couple. Johnson and Rol\u00f3n initially refused to give up their seats. When forced to leave, they took the names of everyone involved, and soon contacted attorney Gloria Allred. Allred, a well-known civil rights attorney, researched the merits of the case and agreed to sign on. The case was front-page news in Los Angeles for several weeks and became a media spectacle. Attorney Gloria Allred described the case in this way: \u201cThe first case that I can remember that I did was that Papa Choux case. Papa Choux was a fine dining restaurant in Los Angeles. My clients were an African American woman and her Latina partner. They were both businesswomen; made a reservation to celebrate Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday. And, in the Papa Choux restaurant, they had a special section for romantic dining. Patrons would walk up a few steps into a special section, which was a semicircle of booths with sheer curtains. Violinists would come by and play the violins; you could close the curtains and, you know, dine in semi-privacy and kiss or have your wine. They made a reserva- tion for the booths and were seated there at first, but then told by the man- ager that they could sit anywhere in the restaurant but there. And they were told one of the reasons was because it was for couples only. And they said, \u2018Well, what are we?\u2019 We\u2019re not chopped liver; we\u2019re a couple. Then they said that it was a house policy that no one could sit in that section unless they were a couple.\u201d 1 Papa Choux newspaper ad, June 24, 1983. \f",

A tableau is a living picture, a scene created by one or more participants, sometimes in costume, always silent, and very carefully posed! Props are allowed. Directions 1. In collaborative groups, choose one example of nonviolent protest from your Methods of Nonviolent and\/or Nonverbal Protest Organizer on page 10. 2. In class or outside of class, research this protest. 3. Look at other examples of tableaus (e.g., at http:\/\/sites.psu.edu\/morethanaselfie\/tableau-vivant\/) and find out more about how they are used. 4. Design your tableau. You can replicate a photograph or create a tableau from your own imagination. Ask other classmates to participate in the tableau if you need more characters. Be creative and have fun! 5. Collaborate with your classmates to create a tableau that captures the most important aspect of the protest. Carefully craft gestures, facial expressions, and physical poses.

Work together to formulate your answers and write them down. (You will not be able to use your notes during the panel discussion.) Practice answering the questions within your group. 2. A facilitator will ask every panel member to answer two questions, but you will not know in advance which questions you will be asked. 3. You will have 1 to 2 minutes to answer each question. Remember that your body communicates as well as your voice! Are you sitting up? Do you look interested? Are you speaking to the whole class? While this is a collaborative effort, you will be graded individually. Discussion Questions Note: If you and your classmates have kept a log of questions during the inquiry process, these ques- tions can also be used as panel discussion questions. Your teacher may ask additional questions as well. 1. Can you tell the class the topic your group researched and briefly describe the historical event your tableau depicted? 2. Can you explain the meaning of your tableau and how your group decided on the idea that you presented? 3. Tell us about one of the participants in this protest. What role did this person play? What was the person\u2019s motivation? 4. How did your group choose this particular topic to research? (Provide a clear explanation.) 5. What primary and secondary sources did you use when doing your research? 6. What was the immediate result of this protest? 7. What were some of the long-term results of this protest? 8. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of this protest? 9. Can you connect the protest you studied to a current protest? If the protest you studied is a current protest, can you connect it to a protest in the past? 10. The Essential Question for this unit in our history class is,\u201cHas the United States of America lived up to the promise and potential of its history and status?\u201d Based on the protest you studied, how would you answer this question? \f",

In the late 1980s, I recorded a hundred interviews for a book I was writing about the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment, which we called the gay rights movement back then. After I finished the book, the cassette tapes sat in stor- age for almost 30 years\u2026 But then I dug them out, the New York Public Library digitized them, and I took a listen. Suddenly, I was back with all these people again\u2014at their dining room tables, in their living rooms, sit- ting across from them and hearing about their lives\u2026 Now I get to share these amazing stories with you. Indi- vidual stories that connect to the bigger story of American civil rights. Sylvia Rivera: Here, I\u2019m out there being a revolutionist for everybody else. I said now it\u2019s time to do my thing for my own people. Zandra Rol\u00f3n: [He] kept giving us the, you know, the back of the bus type of thing, you know.\u201cWell, you can sit over there. And you can sit over here and you\u2019ll have free drinks. But you will not, you cannot sit here. You will not be served here.\u201d Deborah Johnson: And if there\u2019s any- thing that King had taught us, it was that we could sit anywhere in the restaurant we wanted to sit. Ellen DeGeneres: For me on the show to be able to say,\u201cI\u2019m gay,\u201d was like\u2026 I mean, I cried every take we did. Every time we did that. Even in rehearsal I\u2019d cry when I did it. Because it was such a release for me. Morty Manford: What, maybe a thou- sand people sitting in the audience. And the mayor was up at the podium talking. It was just me. What was I going to do? I did what anyone else would do. I walked onto the stage and I took the podium away from John Lindsay. Perry Watkins: Things are gonna have to change drastically in this country. People are gonna have to wake up and realize, wait a minute, I am an average American citizen. Whether I\u2019m gay or lesbian or anything else, given that simple fact alone, there is no way in hell I should have gone through what I went through in the military. Eric Marcus: Three decades ago, when I started researching and interviewing for my book, I was outraged that I\u2019d never heard these stories before\u2014 stories of accidental activists, commit- ted revolutionaries, and happy civil rights warriors, who gave me a greater understanding of who I am and where I\u2019m from. My hope is that by sharing these stories with you now, in a way that wasn\u2019t possible when I was a student, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of how individuals\u2014people like you and me\u2014can challenge laws, institutions, and assumptions and come together to make big changes.

Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988, I conducted a hun- dred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato. Deborah grew up in Los Angeles in what she described as a very \u201cupper-middle-class bourgeois black household\u2014a very well-rooted, extremely well-connected family.\u201d Deborah called Zandra\u2019s family \u201ca Mexican commune.\u201d Zandra explained, jokingly, that she was related to three quarters of the population in Brownsville, Texas. Back in January 1983, they were a young couple on what was supposed to be a romantic date night. But when they faced discrimination over their dinner reservation, they refused to back down. Speaking to me in 1991, Zandra told me that she made the reservation for a special occasion. Z: At the time I was working on Satur- days. So this was the first weekend that we were gonna have a complete week- end together since we had gotten together. It was also the year right before Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday was made into a holiday. And a friend of mine told me about this restaurant that was really nice. And the restaurant had these six booths on one side that were real romantic. And we got there and the, um, waiter kind of questioned us about,\u201cAre you sure you want the booths?\u201d And we told him, yes. And it\u2019s the type of booths Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Part I Transcript In this Give Voice to History Project archival audio oral history recorded in 1991, you will hear Deborah Johnson (\u201cD\u201d in the transcript), Zandra Rol\u00f3n (\u201cZ\u201d), and the interviewer, Eric Marcus (\u201cE\u201d). where you have to move the table out so that you can get in\u2014like a horse- shoe. And in the middle of the horse- shoe was like a fountain and there was a guy with a, a violinist who came around. And right in front of the table was a little white sheer curtain that closed. And candlelight. And it was just romantic. E: Did it occur to you that this might be a problem? Z: Not at all. I mean, to me, discrimi- nation never enters my mind first, ever. So they showed us to our table. We sit down. And we\u2019re taking our jackets off and this tall humongous guy comes by and... D: \u2026 and yanked the table away and told us, you know, you know,\u201cSo sorry, but you can't sit here. It\u2019s against the law to serve two men or two women in these booths.\u201d Z: We asked to see the manager. D: We were not going to move. Z: The guy that turned out to be the real ma\u00eetre \u2019d kept giving us the, you know, the back of the bus type of thing. \u201cWell, you can sit over there. And you can sit over here and you\u2019ll have free drinks.\u201d The whole thing.\u201cBut you will not, you cannot sit here.

And, I mean, he looked at us like, you know, You can rot and freeze your ass over in hell. You know, we will serve you someplace else, but this section is for other kinds of people than you. Z: We left fuming and taking every- body\u2019s name, just fuming. I have never, ever, ever been denied blatantly anything because of who I was, ever. You know, I knew about, you know, the discrimination that went on. My grandfather... it was segregated and segregated meant white and others, you know. So I had heard about the dis- crimination that my grandfather had to go through. But never did it happen to me. And I had never been told that I couldn\u2019t do something or have some- thing or be somewhere or\u2026 because of who I was or the color of my skin. And I\u2026 How dare you! How dare you! E: So you walk out of there and you want to do what? Z: In the beginning when we left the restaurant we were both in agreement that we\u2019ve got to do something. D: But we decided that we were going to talk to Gloria Allred. Gloria Allred is a very famous civil rights attorney. My intention, when I went to the attor- ney, was just to get the restaurant to stop doing it, that\u2019s all. Having a public case was not our intent. It was a price that we had to pay. Z: Gloria Allred finally did the research and told us that we did have a case, that there was a law, a city ordinance that prohibited against discrimination on the basis of sex. D: But it was untested. Sexual prefer- ence. But it had been untested. And it basically was her call. Where essentially what she said was that it\u2019s a very grey matter of the law here. She says, but essentially what\u2019s more is the public consciousness-raising and benefit that could be done with this case, which was raise the issues, which wound up hap- pening, because it was an extremely public case. Z: They fought, they put ads in the paper saying basically... D: They kept taking ads out against us... Z: Saying,\u201cWe can go to jail, they can hang us by our thumbs, but we\u2019re not going to serve two men or two women.\u201d D: \u201cThis makes a mockery, a charade out of true romantic dining.\u201d Z: \u201cGloria Allred has gone too far in leading her own parade.\u201d Z and D: \u201cWe\u2019ll go to jail, we\u2019ll hang by our thumbs... but we will never serve two men or two women.\u201d E: This isn\u2019t the end of the story for Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato.

E: I\u2019m Eric Marcus from Making Gay History. Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988, I conducted a hun- dred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. We\u2019re back with Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato for the second part of their story of how they challenged discrimination after a Los Angeles restaurant refused to seat them in a romantic booth for two. D: When we filed, we filed under two laws. One was a local ordinance, which was a city ordinance that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, specifically in housing, employment, and public accommoda- tions. We also filed under the state Unruh Civil Rights Act. Unruh is the guy, Jesse Unruh, was the author of the bill. The Unruh Civil Rights Act pro- hibits discrimination on the basis of sex, creed, race, color, nationality, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it doesn\u2019t specifically say sexual orientation, so the courts have been interpreting that. So, we went to court, first time go- round, for an injunction. An injunction is basically to ask the restaurant not to do it anymore. The lower court said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that because we think it\u2019s an important issue and it should really go to trial. And if we issue that injunction the restaurant may be hurt, and, furthermore, we're not so sure, basically, that you have any rights as lesbians.\u201dYou know, because the lower court thought that there was a double standard in society. That\u2019s what he said, and that is what went on the paper\u2014that behavior that was okay for straight people in public was not okay for gay people and that the public might be offended by us. We were basically asking him to jump the gun to... Z: \u2026 and make a decision. D: Yes, stop the practice. You don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to go to court. Issue an injunction. Stop the practice now so that nobody else gets hurt. And he\u2019s saying,\u201cWell, I\u2019m not willing to jump the gun, because I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. You should go to court. You should have a trial.\u201d We go to court, again, for what\u2019s called a motion of summary judgment, which is in lieu of a trial, which basi- cally says, you know, here are all the facts. Nobody disputes the facts, give us a ruling. He didn\u2019t want to touch it with a ten-foot pole either. Then it makes it to the appellate court. E: Every time there\u2019s a decision\u2026 Z: Major, major. We\u2019re in magazines, we\u2019re in every single newspaper. D: Los Angeles Magazine. Z: Los Angeles Times, the Valley. E: And every single time\u2026 Z: And front page! D: The appellate court basically over- turned the lower court decisions. The lower courts rule against us and the ap- pellate court rules for us, so they have a right to petition the Supreme Court, which they did. When the Supreme Court said they weren\u2019t going to hear it, then that meant that the next lowest 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 \f",
        "23": "23 level, the appellate court\u2019s ruling, was going to stand. There\u2019s like a four- or five-day window in between the appel- late court finding out that the Supreme Court is not going to hear and them following through with what they started to do in the first place. In that window, they closed down and had all of these ads and had this public wake, and everything else. So, it\u2019s like rather than serve us and comply with the law, they just closed the booths.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it at all.\u201d So they had a pub- lic wake, with the cameras from the 11 o\u2019clock news and the whole bit. Free drinks.\u201cTrue romantic dining died on this day.\u201d Ads out. Z: Yeah, it was terrible. D: And they closed it. Z: They, from the very beginning, put the boxing gloves on. Their intent was, we\u2019re going to fight you to the very end, which is what we ended up doing. E: So that was the end of the booths? Z: That was the end of the booths, that was the end of the booths. D: Well, yeah, because we went back, and then they issued the injunction and they issued the motion of sum- mary judgment. We won and they paid the attorney\u2019s fees and gave us our fine, 250 dollars a piece, which was the fine for the local (audience) ordinance. Z: They had to pay the attorney\u2019s fees, which was almost\u2026 D: Almost 30,000, almost 30,000 dol- lars. So they closed the booths. It\u2019s kind of like what they did in Mississippi and Alabama. You know. Instead of letting the black kids swim in the public pools, they just closed the pool. E: Right. Pull white kids out of the public school and start an academy... D: Yeah, that\u2019s what they did, they just closed it. E: Was it worth it? Z and D: Oh, yeah. Oh, hell yeah. E: Even though the owner of the Papa Choux restaurant simply carted his romantic booths to the curb, Deborah and Zandra\u2019s case put teeth into the local gay rights ordinance. While their case didn\u2019t actually change California\u2019s civil rights bill to add sexual orientation, the appellate court interpreted the law to include sexual orientation. Also, their high-profile court chal- lenge made national news and showed the impact of prejudice on ordinary citizens who were simply trying to live their lives. 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 \f",
