        "4": "4 About \u201cWe the People\u201d Introduction This \u201cWe the People\u201d CIVIC (Connecting Individual Voices to Intersecting Concepts) Inquiry Kit expands the American Civil Rights Movement to include Gay Rights and the LGBT movement. It brings this story to life through archival audio oral history testimony from the Give Voice to History Project, which is pro- duced in partnership with the Making Gay History podcast. In their own voices, trailblazers of the LGBT civil rights movement, including Perry Watkins, Morty Manford, Sylvia Rivera, and Ellen DeGeneres, explain how discriminatory laws, policies, and cultural practices led them to intentional or incidental activism. With this CIVIC Inquiry Kit, students explore primary and secondary sources that connect the Give Voice to History Project archival audio oral histories to \u25cf the history of the evolving policy regarding homosexuals and military service; \u25cf Gay Rights activism in New York City from the 1950s to 1980s; \u25cf Gay Rights groups in New York City from the 1950s to 1980s; \u25cf the cultural perception and representation of gay people in the media (film, television, and print). Students engage with skills-based activities to contextualize the American Civil Rights Movement, analyze methods of challenging discrimination, and explore the intersectionality of race, gender, and sexual orientation within the context of civil rights. The \u201cBuilding a Nation\u201d visual analysis assessment requires students to cite evidence to demonstrate understanding of connections to the present and substan- tiate their interpretations through historical reference. Note: The language introduced in this CIVIC Inquiry Kit mirrors language in the primary and secondary source materials. Using historically accurate language is necessary to understand the social, political, and cultural perceptions of those we label and understand today as LGBTQ+ (including, but not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer). \u201cGay Rights and the LGBT movement\u201d is language used in the New York State Education Department Grade 11 Social Studies Scope and Sequence. Learning Outcomes Students will use transferable skills-based practices to demonstrate an understanding of Gay Rights and the LGBT movement, and will be able to \u25cf evaluate and interpret connections between primary and secondary sources relating to Gay Rights and the LGBT movement; \u25cf create meaningful and persuasive arguments connecting Gay Rights and the LGBT movement to the American Civil Rights Movement; \u25cf define and cite evidence of de jure (in law) and de facto (in fact) discrimination; \u25cf analyze and evaluate how individuals challenged laws, policies, and positions of power to strive for extensions of freedom, social justice, and human rights; \u25cf cite primary and secondary source evidence and analysis to demonstrate understanding of connections to the present. \f",

        "8": "8 Inquiry EduSystem How Is the Inquiry EduSystem Different? 1. The role of the teacher is fluid: In preparing to present the inquiry, the teacher considers what materials need scaffolding. Initially, the teacher acts as content curator, providing explicit instruction as needed. Next, they become facilitator as students explore. Then it\u2019s time to be the chal- lenger, looking carefully at students\u2019 assumptions, asking incisive questions, and insisting that they support their ideas with evidence\/data\/research. Finally, the teacher becomes facilitator again as students demonstrate learning through action or authentic assessment. The teacher\u2019s role is critical to the success of the inquiry process throughout. 2. The roles of the students are also fluid: Students\u2019 roles change throughout the inquiry process as students examine evidence, work collaboratively, explore independently, discover intersections with concurrent events, and make relevant connections to the present. 3. Includes materials for a diversity of learners: Scaffolded, skill-based activities benefit the exceptional learner, the ELL student, and the gifted student. The activities give students options for interaction. 4. Includes student collaboration and independent study: Students have multiple opportunities for small and large group collaboration, processing, individualized work, and reflection. For students who work well on their own, there are ample materials to meet those needs. 5. Each topic is addressed in a framework of concurrent events: Intersections between the main topic and other concurrent events create context for the learning activity. By placing the topic in a larger framework, students can avoid presentism1 and snap judgments based on their own experience. The History UnErased (HUE) Inquiry EduSystem\u2122 is designed as a flexible and fluid support for teachers and students. By providing background information, connections, intersections, skill-based activities, assessments, and opportunities for exploration and discussion, the HUE Inquiry EduSystem leads to successful outcomes for all students. 1 \u201cUncritical adherence to present-day attitudes, especially the tendency to interpret past events in terms of modern values and concepts.\u201d (Oxford Dictionaries, s.v. \u201cpresentism,\u201d accessed August 4, 2018, https:\/\/en.oxforddictionaries.com\/definition\/presentism.) 6. The material helps students connect the topic to the present: Suggested connections to the present are included in every inquiry. Students are encouraged to dig deeper within and outside of the topic. This creates dynamic interaction, real-world relevance, and individualized\/ personalized learning opportunities. 7. Includes authentic summative assessments: Summative assessments are authentic and have consequences beyond a grade. By offering ideas for structuring these assessments, final projects, and action activities, the teacher ensures that students feel empowered to demonstrate what they have learned. \f",
        "9": "Process Overview Throughout the Inquiry EduSystem process, the roles of teachers and students are fluid, as are the inquiry components. Input Phase (Teacher-Directed) The teacher \u25cf explains outcomes; \u25cf reviews guiding or essential questions; \u25cf activates prior knowledge; \u25cf presents curated content; \u25cf provides background information. Interact Phase (Student-Centered) In collaborative groups, students \u25cf discuss and\/or journal discussion questions, record observations, and ask additional questions for further exploration; \u25cf complete extension activities to support all learners (e.g., vocabulary or skill-based exercises); \u25cf analyze content through different Lenses of Analysis (can be completed in either the Interact Phase or Dig Deeper Phase). Dig Deeper Phase (Student-Directed) In collaborative groups or independently, students \u25cf research questions and areas of interest discovered during the Interact Phase; \u25cf analyze content through different Lenses of Analysis (can be completed in either the Interact Phase or Dig Deeper Phase). Output Phase (Assessment) Students \u25cf participate in whole group discussion; \u25cf engage with extension games; \u25cf find intersections with similar concurrent events or thematic events; \u25cf make connections to the present via discussion or assessment; \u25cf engage with traditional assessments; \u25cf engage with authentic assessments. 9 \f",

        "13": "13 Stonewall Riots Background The Stonewall riots, which were a key turning point for the LGBT movement, began in the early morning hours of Saturday, June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village. Back then, the police routinely raided gay bars, conducted uncalled-for ID checks, and made arrests\u2014often roughing up patrons in the process. As the police checked IDs, harassed Stonewall patrons, and made arrests, people became increasingly angry. Patrons resisted and a crowd gathered outside. Protesters hurled bottles and debris at the police and through the bar\u2019s windows. The police reacted with violence, beating and arresting the patrons-turned-protesters. The riots con- tinued from Saturday until Wednesday, with hundreds of people joining in on the fight. But Stonewall wasn\u2019t the first confrontation between the police and LGBT people. In 1959, patrons of Cooper\u2019s Donuts in Los Angeles, an all-night restaurant that was in the Skid Row neighborhood and was popular with drag queens and people who today might identify as transgender, responded to police harassment one evening by chasing off the officers who fled in a patrol car. Eight years later, after the Los Angeles police beat and arrested gay patrons at the Black Cat Tavern who were ringing in the New Year, PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education) organized a protest that drew hundreds of participants. In 1966 at Compton\u2019s Cafeteria in San Francisco, drag queens and transgender patrons fought back against the police when they were attempting to arrest a patron for \u201cfemale impersonation,\u201d smashing windows, vandalizing a police car, and burning down a nearby newspaper stand. The following evening, in response to a decision by the restaurant\u2019s owners to ban drag queens and transgender patrons, community members picketed the restaurant. Nonviolent methods of resistance also occurred before the Stonewall riots, including the regional East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO) marches in Philadelphia. While these early confrontations and protests didn\u2019t get the attention of the Stonewall riots, they were important milestones of resistance. Today, Stonewall symbolizes many things, but, most importantly, it served as a catalyst for the uprising that occurred after the riots, when the burgeoning national LGBT liberation movement experienced explosive growth and became more visible, political, and powerful. Relevant Gay Rights groups: \u25cf Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was formed in New York City in 1969 immediately after the Stonewall riots. \u25cf Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) was founded by former members of GLF in December of 1969 in New York City. \u25cf Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) was created in 1970 to advocate on behalf of homeless drag queens and runaways in New York City. \f",

Discriminatory practice of enlisting people of color (during the Vietnam War) despite the individual responding \u201cyes\u201d to the Army entrance form question, \u201cAre you a homosexual?\u201d b. The Army did not enforce its policy banning homo- sexuals from military service and denied Watkins\u2019s three requests for discharge. c. The Army did not conduct an investigation of the individuals responsible for assaulting Watkins, but instead investigated whether or not Watkins was a homosexual. d. The Army discharged Watkins after 15 years of exemplary service because he was an admitted homosexual. 2. Explain whether the discriminatory practice was de jure (in law) or de facto (in fact). a. De jure: The U.S. military policy banned homosexuals from military service. b. De facto: The Army enlisted Watkins despite his state- ment that he was a homosexual; the individuals who assaulted Watkins were not investigated; and Watkins was denied the opportunity to work as a chaplain\u2019s assistant because he was an admitted homosexual. 3. Which method or strategy did this individual use to challenge the discriminatory law, policy, or cultural practice? Watkins sued the U.S. Army, arguing that banning gays and lesbians from military service was unconstitutional.

In the late 1980s, I recorded a hundred interviews for a book I was writing about the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment, which we called the gay rights movement back then. After I finished the book, the cassette tapes sat in stor- age for almost 30 years\u2026 But then I dug them out, the New York Public Library digitized them, and I took a listen. Suddenly, I was back with all these people again\u2014at their dining room tables, in their living rooms, sitting across from them and hearing about their lives\u2026 Now I get to share these amazing stories with you. Indi- vidual stories that connect to the bigger story of American civil rights. Sylvia Rivera: Here, I\u2019m out there being a revolutionist for everybody else. I said now it\u2019s time to do my thing for my own people. Zandra Rol\u00f3n: [He] kept giving us the, you know, the back of the bus type of thing, you know.\u201cWell, you can sit over there. And you can sit over here and you\u2019ll have free drinks. But you will not, you cannot sit here.

Because it was such a release for me. Morty Manford: What, maybe a thou- sand people sitting in the audience. And the mayor was up at the podium talking. It was just me. What was I going to do? I did what anyone else would do. I walked onto the stage and I took the podium away from John Lindsay. Perry Watkins: Things are gonna have to change drastically in this country. People are gonna have to wake up and realize, wait a minute, I am an average American citizen. Whether I\u2019m gay or lesbian or anything else, given that simple fact alone, there is no way in hell I should have gone through what I went through in the military. Eric Marcus: Three decades ago, when I started researching and interviewing for my book, I was outraged that I\u2019d never heard these stories before\u2014 stories of accidental activists, commit- ted revolutionaries, and happy civil rights warriors, who gave me a greater understanding of who I am and where I\u2019m from. My hope is that by sharing these stories with you now, in a way that wasn\u2019t possible when I was a student, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of how individuals\u2014people like you and me\u2014can challenge laws, institutions, and assumptions and come together to make big changes.

        "19": "19 Eric: I\u2019m Eric Marcus from Making Gay History. Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988 I conducted a hundred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Perry Watkins. In the late 1960s, as social and political upheaval rocked the world, Perry was a 19-year- old African American man living in Germany and studying dance. On the other side of the world, the Vietnam War was at its peak with more than a half-million U.S. troops deployed there. At that time, all young men in the U.S. had to register for military service and were assigned a number. If their num- ber came up, they were drafted, in other words, ordered to report for duty. Young Perry was one of nearly 300,000 young men drafted in 1968. As an out gay man he had every reason to believe that after a quick trip to an Army induction center in the States, he\u2019d be back in Europe and dancing again because gay people weren\u2019t allowed to serve. But that\u2019s not what happened. Eric: Did you know you wanted to work in the military? Perry: I didn\u2019t want to. I did not check the box \u201cyes\u201d because I wanted to go into the military. I laugh when the Army now defends their, you know, \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s just so terrible\u2026\u201d All they had to do was comply with their regulation, which said they cannot take me if I check that box. Eric: You checked the box. Perry Watkins Transcript Perry: I checked the box \u201cyes\u201d and I was drafted anyway. Eric: You checked the box that said \u201chomosexuality\u201d? Perry: Would you like to see a copy of the form? Eric: I believe you! I believe you! You checked the homosexual box. Perry: Yes. Eric: You were drafted. Perry: Yes. I would be curious to do a statistical report, an investigative type report on the number of people who checked the box \u201cyes,\u201d what their race was, and how many of them that were white were drafted anyway. Eric: What year were you drafted? Perry: 1968. Eric: Vietnam War. Perry: Yeah, good thinkin\u2019. Eric: Were you shocked? Perry: Yes! That\u2019s why I find it abso- lutely ludicrous that the Army is in court saying,\u201cWe don\u2019t want this man.\u201d Why the hell did you take me? Fifteen years later, I\u2019m still in court. I lost\u2026 This is a rental. I used to own a house not a mile from here. I lost it because when I got thrown out of the Army I didn\u2019t have an income. I don\u2019t have heat in my house now because I don\u2019t make enough money to turn on the heat. But yet I\u2019m dealing with a system of justice who\u2019s looking at the facts in my case and going,\u201cWell, we can\u2019t tell the Army not to comply with their 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 \f",
        "20": "20 regulation.\u201d Well, who the [...] told them not to comply with it to begin with? Eric: So you\u2019re drafted. Perry: I\u2019m drafted, yeah. Eric: And what do you wind up doing in the military then? Perry: I was assigned to personnel, administration, of course, because I knew how to type, I can read and write. I could also speak a little German and a little Spanish. A lot of German and a little Spanish. After that I was assigned to school to be a chaplain\u2019s assistant. I am called into the commandant\u2019s office and I\u2019m told,\u201cYou can\u2019t complete this course. No, you can\u2019t stay.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWell, because you\u2019re gay, and I can\u2019t have a chaplain\u2019s assistant who\u2019s gay.\u201d Fine, then put me out of the Army. He refused to put me out. I said,\u201cWait a minute. If I\u2019m gay enough not to be in this school, I\u2019m gay enough to be out of the military.\u201d I requested discharge three times. Eric: No one would believe you. Perry: No, they wouldn\u2019t! I get to my unit. Basically, everybody in the unit just kind of accepted me. Until one night five guys decided to sexually assault me. Eric: They assaulted you. Perry: Yeah. They tried real hard. They ran me around pretty good. Eric: You must have been scared half to death. Perry: Yeah, more than half. [Laughs.] But, I go in the next morning and I said,\u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to deal with this. No, I want out.\u201d Do you know what the military did? What they inves- tigated was not the assault. Our system of justice, our system, our military sys- tem of justice...\u201cOh, that\u2019s alright for them to assault you. But we\u2019ve gotta prove is that you\u2019re gay. The crime is not that they assaulted you, the crime is that you are an admitted homosexual.\u201d I am not going to put up with this kind of shit.\u201cI am gay, you people put me in this damn Army, and it\u2019s up to you to see to it that I am protected.\u201d I never had another problem in the remaining 15 years. Eric: So this is all in the first year. Perry: This is within the first six months. So that\u2019s kinda how that relates... Eric: So you spent the next 15 years doing what? Perry: Having a wonderful time. I worked in personnel, I went to college and got a four-year degree. I traveled, I lived in Europe for eight years, I lived in Korea for two. I was not sitting there stagnating and waiting to retire, it wasn\u2019t like I wasn\u2019t being productive, I obviously was. I didn\u2019t get an exem- plary record for nothing. Every unit I went to people looked at me and said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re gay.\u201d Right, I\u2019m openly gay! They opened my records, and\u2014good grief!\u2014everything they see says,\u201cThis man is a homosexual, but he functions in an exemplary manner.\u201d Fine. Every time I was sent to a psychiatrist for an evaluation, they would do the same thing: \u201cYes, he is homosexual. But no, it is not detrimental to his job perfor- mance.\u201d Exactly what they would write in a record, you know? Eric: What changed? Perry: In 1980, when I came back from Germany to Fort Lewis, Washing- 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 \f",
        "21": "21 ton, the Army had told me they were going to revoke my security clearance because I was gay. This is the fourth time the Army is telling me this. Well, when we filed in court to have my security clearance reinstated, the Army immediately jumped up and said, \u201cWell, he can\u2019t be in the Army anyway, because he\u2019s gay.\u201d Suddenly, we\u2019re gonna change the rules of the game. They never even mentioned discharge until I took them to court to get my clearance back. And then it was,\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to discharge you.\u201d Eric: If you win, will you continue to speak out on the issue...? Perry: You\u2019re damn right I will! Certainly! Things are gonna have to change drastically in this country. People are gonna have to wake up and realize, wait a minute, I am an average American citizen. Whether I\u2019m gay or lesbian or anything else, given that simple fact alone, there is no way in hell I should have gone through what I went through in the military. Eric: Perry Watkins said the reason the Army took him in the first place was they expected him to come home from Vietnam in a body bag. In the early years of the Vietnam War, a dispropor- tionate number of black men were assigned to combat units and didn\u2019t make it home alive. Perry wasn\u2019t sent to Vietnam. Instead, he wound up serving on the front lines of an eight-year legal battle with his employer, the U.S. military. In 1989 a federal appeals court ordered Perry\u2019s reinstatement to the Army. It was the first ruling by a full appellate panel that struck at the military\u2019s ban on gay and lesbian service members. President George H.W. Bush\u2019s adminis- tration appealed that ruling, but in November 1990, the Supreme Court, without comment, let it stand. He had the option to reenlist, but he took a settlement instead and retired with a promotion and full benefits. In 1993, he celebrated his victory as the grand marshal of New York City\u2019s annual Pride march. Perry Watkins died of complications from AIDS just three years later. He was 48. So long. Until next time. 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 205 210 215 220 \f",

Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988 I conducted a hundred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Morty Manford. In the early 1970s he was a young activist who very publicly challenged New York City\u2019s mayor over police brutality against the city\u2019s gay citizens. The mayor also happened to be running for president. When I interviewed Morty in 1989, his activist days were long since behind him. By then, he was a 39-year-old lawyer working for the New York State attorney general\u2019s office. But I asked him to take me back in time, to his early days as a fearless young man. Eric: I want to ask you about an NYU [New York University] protest, uh, where you broke into the hall where the mayor was speaking. Morty: That was my 21st birthday. There had been some raids. The police were out going wild raiding the bars. They did this each year as the elections started to roll around. They\u2019d want to build up their statistics to show the police were making arrests and they were arresting all these perverts. Those were the sorts of things they\u2019d say in the New York Times. Anyway, we had already reached the point where we weren\u2019t going to just stand by and let this stuff happen. And there was a big uproar at One Sheridan Square, which was a bar. And the police had physically beat some gay people who were there. The police brutality against the gays was the inspi- ration for the demonstration at NYU against John Lindsay. It was a pretty quickly organized protest. Everybody was having trouble getting inside. Somehow or another I got inside. Eric: All by yourself. You were the only one to get in. Morty: Yeah. What, maybe a thousand people sitting in the audience. And the mayor was up at the podium talking. It was just me. What was I going to do? I did what anyone else would do. I walked onto the stage and I took the podium away from John Lindsay. [Both laugh.] I walked up right next to him and I said, so the audience could hear, \u201cThe police are brutalizing gay people three blocks away from where we\u2019re sitting\u2026\u201d The police harassment and attacks were even going on that night. That was one of the points that I made. I wasn\u2019t there very long but what I said made an impression. The police dragged me off the back of the stage and they ejected me through, you know, some or another exit. After I left, the audience called the mayor to account for what was going on with the police bothering the gay community. And apparently John 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 \f",
        "23": "23 Lindsay had made the statement that he would permit me to speak. Of course, he knew darn well the police had already thrown me out, didn\u2019t realize that I would come back. And I snuck back in. I mean, I broke through their security lines again. I can\u2019t tell you how I did it, but I got back in and I came right down that aisle. And I could see him looking up from the podium at me, you know, bit- ing his lip and saying,\u201cOh shit, here he comes again.\u201d And I walked right back up on stage and I said to him,\u201cI under- stand you said I could speak.\u201d And he said,\u201cYes,\u201d and he yielded the podium to me. And I addressed the audience about the police brutality and the harassment we were facing. And I said my piece. I thanked them and I left as surreptitiously as I\u2019d entered. See, I had this thing with John Lindsay. Somehow or another we had encounter after encounter face to face. There were several examples, I mean, I got arrested in his presidential head- quarters. There was a big demonstration at Radio City, and it was very well planned. The Political Action Commit- tee with GAA [Gay Activists Alliance] did the planning. As soon as Lindsay, uh, came to the podium, I went right up to the railing at the front of the bal- cony and handcuffed myself to it. And I made my statement,\u201cHomosexuals need your help to end police harass- ment.\u201d And some people had these little pocket alarms, I mean, and it created upset. Lindsay wasn\u2019t allowed to speak. We were all shouting that the police were harassing gays in the city, they were brutalizing gays, you\u2019ve got to stop this. You know, while we were honking and hooting and shouting our one-liners, you could see their sense of loss. They lost this battle. Eric: The confrontational protests that Morty Manford and the other young post-Stonewall activists engaged in were called \u201czaps.\u201d And they worked. Before long the police began showing restraint and the bar raids came to an end. Zap-like tactics were a hallmark of LGBTQ and AIDS activism into the 1990s and continue to be used today. Morty Manford died of complica- tions from AIDS on May 14, 1992. He was 41 years old. So long. Until next time. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 \f",
        "24": "24 Sylvia Rivera Transcript Eric: I\u2019m Eric Marcus from Making Gay History. Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988 I conducted a hundred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Sylvia Rivera. Trans icon, LGBTQ civil rights activist, and self- described troublemaker. When I met Sylvia, she was living in a run- down apartment in North Tarrytown, New York, about 30 miles north of Manhattan. Sylvia was dressed in a black halter top, hot pink Spandex pants, and beige knee-high boots with chunky heels. I was wearing an orange down parka and green corduroys and I looked like I\u2019d stepped off the \u201cF\u201d train from Queens, which is where I\u2019m from. Sylvia was striking: high cheekbones, wide-spaced eyes, bright red lipstick. With a gap-toothed smile she wel- comed me into her steamy kitchen. While she stirred a pot of chili on the stove, she began reminiscing about joining the movement in the late 1960s. Sylvia: I guess my revolutionary blood was going back then. Before the Stonewall I was involved in the black liberation movement, the peace move- ment. Because I had to. I had so much anger. About the world, the way it was. The way they were treating people. When the Stonewall happened, I said, here, I\u2019m out there being a revolutionist for everybody else. I said now it\u2019s time to do my thing for my own people. Eric: Do you think all this was in part because people were so angry for so long? Sylvia: People were very angry for so long. I mean, how long can you live in the closet? Eric: So what happened after that night then? Did you start going to meetings of some kind? Sylvia: I did join the movement. I joined GAA [Gay Activists Alliance]. And that first year that we were petitioning for gay rights... Eric: So it was 1970. Sylvia: It was 1970. I got arrested for petitioning for gay rights, the city Gay Rights Bill, on 42nd Street. The cops came up to me and said,\u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d I\u2019m like,\u201cWhat do you mean? My Constitution says that I can do any- thing that I want.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, you can\u2019t do this. Either you leave or we\u2019re going to arrest you.\u201d I said,\u201cFine, arrest me.\u201d They very nicely picked me up and threw me in a police car and took me to jail. I went in front of the judge. He\u2019s like,\u201cNumber one, I\u2019m letting him go.\u201d He says,\u201cBut you don\u2019t realize what you just did.\u201d Eric: To the policeman. Sylvia: Uh-huh.\u201cYou don\u2019t realize what you just did.\u201d He says,\u201cThe whole country is going up in an uproar and you are messing with people\u2026\u201d Eric: Who are circulating petitions. Sylvia: Right. And I\u2019m like,\u201cAh, okay.\u201d They let me out. They let me go home. Eric: Were you part of\u2026? There was a protest at NYU [New York University]. There was a dance. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 \f",
        "25": "25 Sylvia: That was one of the sit-ins. It was a nice sit-in for three or four days. My brothers and sisters from the gay community themselves were not very, very supportive. Eric: Was STAR formed already by then? Sylvia: Actually STAR was born out of the NYU sit-in. Eric: What does STAR mean? Sylvia: Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. The people that held that sit-in for three days was my people, the people from STAR. The people\u2026 We were there and everybody says always, because you didn\u2019t have a place to live. That wasn\u2019t true, we could have picked up a trick and stayed at a hotel. We were there for them, Marsha, myself, and everybody else. When they came in and threw us out, there was nobody there except what they call the street people or the STAR people. Eric: How many queens were involved in STAR? Was it a small group? Three, four? Half dozen? Sylvia: It was very small. It was like, it was myself, Marsha Johnson, Bambi Lamour, Endora. Bebe, Bebe was part of my group at one time. Eric: What was the reason for starting it? Sylvia: Why was the reason? Because my brothers and sisters kept on using us and we wanted to be by ourselves. Eric: You weren\u2019t getting fairly treated by them? Sylvia: We weren\u2019t. The Gay Liberation Front did give us the vanguard of the revolution. We were the vanguard of the revolution, but Gay Liberation Front was too revolutionary. GAA came into their power at that time. Eric: What were you and Marsha trying to do? What were your hopes then for what you were working for? Sylvia: Marsha and I had a building on Second Street, which we called STAR House. When we asked the community to help us [tears coming down face] there was nobody to help us. We were nothing. We were nothing! They had\u2026 Now we were taking care of kids that were younger than us. I mean, Marsha and I were young and we were taking care of them. And we kept it going for about a year or two. We went out and made that money off the streets to keep these kids off the street. Eric: So, you sold yourselves to take care of the kids. Sylvia: Instead of showing them what we were doing, \u2019cause we already went through it. Eric: Because you wanted to protect them? What were you protecting them from? Sylvia: From the world. From life in general. You know, to show them that there was a better life. Eric: In the years since her death in 2002, Sylvia Rivera has become an icon\u2014a symbol of LGBTQ people fighting against oppression and for respect and equal rights. So long!

        "26": "26 Ellen DeGeneres Transcript Eric: I\u2019m Eric Marcus from Making Gay History. Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988 I conducted a hundred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Ellen DeGeneres. Of course, you probably feel like you already know her. Watching her on TV, it\u2019s easy to believe that she\u2019s always been \u201cEllen\u201d\u2014 out, proud, and maybe the most famous lesbian in the world. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. Let\u2019s go back to 1997, when Ellen came out in the most public way possi- ble. Back then, most LGBTQ people in show business stayed in the closet to protect their careers. She knew she was risking everything by going public. But when I interviewed her in 2001, Ellen told me that coming out in real life\u2014and as her character on her TV sitcom in front of 42 million viewers\u2014 was something she just had to do. Ellen: So for me on the show to be able to say,\u201cI\u2019m gay,\u201d was like\u2026 I mean, I cried every take we did. Every time we did that. Even in rehearsal I\u2019d cry when I did it. Because it was such a release for me. I mean that goes back to\u2026 God, you know, so much that\u2019s around that that just cracked open when I said it. Eric: When the show was over, when you finished taping, was there a reac- tion from the audience at the end? Was there\u2026 What was the feeling on the set? Ellen: I think I was too high to even know. I was like\u2026 Everybody said I looked like, you know, something had just lifted off of me. Eric: Did it? Ellen: Yeah. I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure. I let go of a heaviness, you know. We had to clear out pretty fast because there was a bomb threat. The studio had a bomb threat. So we had to get out real quick. Eric: The bomb threat was because of you and your show, I assume. Ellen: Yes. Yeah. It wasn\u2019t for the catering. Yeah. Eric: What kinds of letters did you get? You said you got hate mail and you also got other mail. What kinds of letters did you get? Ellen: People telling me, writing me or telling me, that they came out because of me. Realizing they were gay because of me. That they didn\u2019t realize it. And also, you know, the parties that went on around the country that night. Like, when else have we had an excuse to have parties like that? Like, I wish that would happen again. I wish somebody would do something so I could have like that kind of\u2026 Because it really did feel like this magical\u2026 Like everybody can remember that night. Like espe- cially in the gay community. You know, it\u2019s just like what happened for every- body. We united and we felt like, you know\u2026 And I can\u2019t really feel that because it was\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m in it so I don\u2019t know what that was like. But I can imagine what that must have been like for everybody else to have that kind of party. And someone called from New York and said, you know, you could just hear like cheering from other apart- ment buildings. And you could\u2026 And that the streets were empty. And restau- rants were closing. And that seems like a lot of fun, you know? Being a comedian it\u2019s a very different thing than being an actor. Because when you\u2019re a comedian you actually 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 Ellen DeGeneres, 1997. Photo by Featureflash Photo Agency\/Shutterstock.com. \f",
        "27": "27 make people happy. So they come up to you and they really have a different response to you. Because they just\u2026 They like you. And also being on TV every single week they feel like they know you. But because of what I did, unless people are just completely narrow-minded and just evil, you know, most people, the reaction that I get, I think that there\u2019s so much respect for what I did. Even if they don\u2019t fully understand it. But they really appreci- ate the fact and understand that I did something that not too many people do. Eric: Did that help sustain you through some of the difficult times that came in the year following? Did that help at all during that following year? Ellen: Yeah. It certainly helped. I mean, if I didn\u2019t have that, I wouldn\u2019t have had, you know\u2026 Because it was\u2026 Because the press got pretty nasty. The press really turned against me. And really took advantage of, you know, pointing out the ratings. You know, sagging ratings and\u2026 It mat- tered to me. Always. It always mattered to me what people thought of me. Even though I\u2019d forgotten that for a while to say,\u201cI\u2019m gay and I\u2019m going to say it and I don\u2019t care what anybody thinks, I don\u2019t care if I lose everything.\u201d Ultimately, when it comes down to it, okay, yes, now I\u2019m gay and I\u2019m free. And then the reality hits like this big wave going,\u201cWe hate you. We think you\u2019re\u2026 You know\u2026 You\u2019re off the air now. We don\u2019t want to watch you. You know\u2026 We\u2019re gonna show you.\u201d When you\u2019re that depressed and people are like,\u201cBut you don\u2019t know how many people, you know, you\u2019ve changed,\u201d and, you know, it\u2019s like, you know, but, yeah, I\u2019m sad... I\u2019m, you know... Eric: How was it coming back? How different was it coming back to stand- up now, from before? Because now you\u2019re coming there as your whole person as opposed to\u2026? Ellen: Yeah, well, it\u2019s great. But that personal stuff had to come out of me to get that out of the way. Because that\u2019s actually\u2026 I keep pointing because there\u2019s a TV there. But it\u2019s more politi- cal and more personal than anything I\u2019ve ever done on stage. And I think I needed to do that. But\u2026 So it\u2019s helped me in being, you know, free to say whatever I want on stage. And not worry that something is going to give something away. And,\u201cOh God, I can\u2019t talk about that because then they\u2019ll know I\u2019m gay.\u201d Or,\u201cI can\u2019t talk about that because that\u2019s going to offend somebody.\u201d Or,\u201cI can\u2019t talk about that because\u2026\u201d It\u2019s like\u2026 Now it\u2019s like, you know\u2026 I\u2019ll just\u2026 I\u2019ll say anything. And to me the only thing that\u2019s impor- tant is honesty. And as long as I\u2019m being honest with my feelings and coming from a good place, and coming from a true place, it\u2019s not gonna\u2026 It can\u2019t possibly hurt anybody. Eric: In the short term, Ellen\u2019s honesty did cost her. The media storm that followed her coming out was a Cate- gory 5 and the backlash included hate mail, death threats, and ultimately the cancellation of her show. When I inter- viewed Ellen in 2001, her place in our hearts and minds and on TV was not guaranteed. I don\u2019t think anyone, including Ellen, would have predicted that she\u2019d go on to host one of the most popular, long-running daytime televi- sion shows of all time. And that\u2019s on top of hosting awards shows, doing stand-up, and winning 30 Emmy Awards and more People\u2019s Choice Awards than anyone. Ever. Add to that the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian award, given to her by then President Barack Obama. So long!
