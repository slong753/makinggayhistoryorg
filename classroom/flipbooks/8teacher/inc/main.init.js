Their story, which frames discriminatory policies and practices related to sexual orien- tation and gender within the broader Civil Rights Movement, is brought to life through archival audio oral history testimony from the Give Voice to History Project, produced in partnership with the Making Gay History podcast. Through kinesthetic learning activities, scaffolded close listening exercises, classroom discussion, collaborative reflection, self-directed research, instructional games that include role-play, and primary and secondary source analysis, this CIVIC Inquiry Kit facilitates the development of transferable skills, such as research skills, the ability to make connections between past events and current issues, collaborative work, and listening skills. It offers technology integration options in the form of projected images and audio extractions\/podcasts. Note: The language introduced in this CIVIC Inquiry Kit mirrors language in the primary and secondary source materials. Using historically accurate language is necessary to understand the social, political, and cultural perceptions of those we label and understand today as LGBTQ+ (including, but not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer). Learning Outcomes By using this CIVIC Inquiry Kit, students will be able to \u25cf explore times, places, and ways in which different groups have struggled for equality; \u25cf analyze nonverbal protests during struggles for equality and evaluate their effectiveness; \u25cf examine laws and practices related to sexual orientation and gender; \u25cf identify the progression of a court case using close listening activities. \f",

        "8": "8 Inquiry EduSystem How Is the Inquiry EduSystem Different? 1. The role of the teacher is fluid: In preparing to present the inquiry, the teacher considers what materials need scaffolding. Initially, the teacher acts as content curator, providing explicit instruction as needed. Next, they become facilitator as students explore. Then it\u2019s time to be the chal- lenger, looking carefully at students\u2019 assumptions, asking incisive questions, and insisting that they support their ideas with evidence\/data\/research. Finally, the teacher becomes facilitator again as students demonstrate learning through action or authentic assessment. The teacher\u2019s role is critical to the success of the inquiry process throughout. 2. The roles of the students are also fluid: Students\u2019 roles change throughout the inquiry process as students examine evidence, work collaboratively, explore independently, discover intersections with concurrent events, and make relevant connections to the present. 3. Includes materials for a diversity of learners: Scaffolded, skill-based activities benefit the exceptional learner, the ELL student, and the gifted student. The activities give students options for interaction. 4. Includes student collaboration and independent study: Students have multiple opportunities for small and large group collaboration, processing, individualized work, and reflection. For students who work well on their own, there are ample materials to meet those needs. 5. Each topic is addressed in a framework of concurrent events: Intersections between the main topic and other concurrent events create context for the learning activity. By placing the topic in a larger framework, students can avoid presentism1 and snap judgments based on their own experience. The History UnErased (HUE) Inquiry EduSystem\u2122 is designed as a flexible and fluid support for teachers and students. By providing background information, connections, intersections, skill-based activities, assessments, and opportunities for exploration and discussion, the HUE Inquiry EduSystem leads to successful outcomes for all students. 1 \u201cUncritical adherence to present-day attitudes, especially the tendency to interpret past events in terms of modern values and concepts.\u201d (Oxford Dictionaries, s.v. \u201cpresentism,\u201d accessed August 4, 2018, https:\/\/en.oxforddictionaries.com\/definition\/presentism.) 6. The material helps students connect the topic to the present: Suggested connections to the present are included in every inquiry. Students are encouraged to dig deeper within and outside of the topic. This creates dynamic interaction, real-world relevance, and individualized\/ personalized learning opportunities. 7. Includes authentic summative assessments: Summative assessments are authentic and have consequences beyond a grade. By offering ideas for structuring these assessments, final projects, and action activities, the teacher ensures that students feel empowered to demonstrate what they have learned. \f",
        "9": "9 Process Overview Throughout the Inquiry EduSystem process, the roles of teachers and students are fluid, as are the inquiry components. Input Phase (Teacher-Directed) The teacher \u25cf introduces learning outcomes; \u25cf reviews guiding questions; \u25cf activates prior knowledge; \u25cf presents curated content; \u25cf provides background information. Interact Phase (Student-Centered) In collaborative groups, students \u25cf discuss, record observations, and ask additional questions for further exploration; \u25cf complete extension activities to support all learners (e.g., vocabulary or skill-based exercises); \u25cf analyze content using content maps, cognitive organizers, or other analysis tools (can be completed in either the Interact Phase or Dig Deeper Phase). Dig Deeper Phase (Student-Directed) In collaborative groups or independently, students \u25cf research questions and areas of interest discovered during the Interact Phase; \u25cf analyze content using content maps, cognitive organizers, or other analysis tools (can be completed in either the Interact Phase or Dig Deeper Phase). Output Phase (Assessment) Students \u25cf participate in whole group discussion; \u25cf find intersections with similar concurrent events or thematic events; \u25cf make connections to the present via discussion or assessment; \u25cf engage with traditional assessments; \u25cf engage with authentic assessments. \f",
        "10": "10 Lesson Plan 1 (Input) Activating Prior Knowledge through Visual Analysis Many different groups have sought equal rights or protested government policy through many different methods. In this lesson, students will examine nonviolent protest that involves a physical stance. Duration: 1 class period Materials: Photo on the right, shown as projected image (preferable) or accessed on page 6 of the Student Guide Guiding Question: How have individuals or groups used nonviolent physical actions as a method of protest? Learning Outcomes: Students will be able to \u25cf identify physical stance as a form of nonviolent protest; \u25cf apply what they already know about the Civil Rights Movement to an analysis of an iconic photo. Step 1: Introduce the Guiding Question and Learning Outcomes. Step 2: \u25cf Project the photo or refer students to the photo on page 6 of the Student Guide. \u25cf Provide background information: This photo is from the third attempt to march from Selma, Alabama, to Mont- gomery, Alabama, that began on March 21, 1965, to protest voting discrimination against African Americans. The first attempt was met with violent attacks from state police and local volunteer police. The second attempt was largely symbolic. President Lyndon Johnson sent the almost 2,000 members of the Alabama National Guard to protect marchers on their third and successful attempt. Marchers walked about 12 miles a day and slept in fields. By the time the protesters reached Montgomery, they were 25,000 strong. For more information go to https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/articles\/selmatomongtomerymarch.htm. \u25cf Suggested visual analysis introduction and questions: Many activists, protesters, and change agents have used their physical stance as a method of protest. Looking at this iconic photo, what do you observe? How are the people in this photo using their physical stance as an act of protest? \u25cf Possible responses: They\u2019ve interlocked arms. They are moving forward. They look determined. \u25cf Students use the Photo Analysis Sheet on page 7 of the Student Guide. Step 3: \u25cf Introduce this quote from Rabbi Heschel: \u201cFor many of us the march from Selma to Montgomery was about protest and prayer. Legs are not lips and walking is not kneeling. And yet our legs uttered songs. Even without words, our march was worship. I felt my legs were praying.\u201d \u25cf Ask students to relate the quote to the photo; note that almost all of the marchers are clergy. \u25cf Possible responses: The marchers saw this protest as their duty. They knew their physical action was more impor- tant than speaking or writing. There were many religious people of different faiths marching. Step 4: \u25cf Introduce the Essential Question for the CIVIC Inquiry Kit: \u201cHas the United States of America lived up to the promise and potential of its history and status?\u201d \u25cf Ask students what criteria they would use to answer this question. \u25cf Possible responses: Poverty levels, safety, equitable treatment, criminal justice system, economic opportu- nity, freedom. \u25cf Ask students to define \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201d \u25cf Introduce the Papa Choux restaurant incident and resulting court case: In this unit, we are going to examine ways in which American people have strived for equality, with a special focus on two women who strived for LGBT equality in 1983.

        "12": "12 Lesson Plan 2 (Interact) Developing Understanding of Nonverbal Communication through a Kinesthetic Activity Students should be in collaborative groups for this lesson. Duration: 1 to 2 class periods Materials: Kinesthetic Activity Scenario Cards (make a copy of the scenarios on the right and cut into cards) Guiding Question: How do our physical actions communi- cate thoughts, feelings, and ideas? Learning Outcome: Through use of a kinesthetic activity, students will demonstrate the power of nonverbal commu- nication and interpret nonverbal communication. Step 1: Divide students into collaborative groups of 3 or 4. Step 2: Students pick a scenario card. Step 3: Explain the rules: \u25cf Each group has 5 minutes to plan how they will act out the scenario. \u25cf When acting out the scenario, there is no speaking (optional: no touching). \u25cf Students can\u2019t show their scenario card to other classmates. Step 4: After students \u201cperform\u201d the scenario, use one or more of the following questions as prompts to help students become aware of their nonverbal communication: \u25cf What did the body language of the performers tell you about this scene? \u25cf What else did you observe in this scene? \u25cf How did the performers use their bodies, facial expressions, or gestures to convey meaning? \u25cf What was the scenario? Rationale for Kinesthetic Activity Susan Griss, author of Minds in Motion: A Kinesthetic Approach to Teaching Elementary Curriculum, offers the following rationale for the use of kinesthetic activities in the classroom: By teaching through the universal language of movement, we can offer a chance for real success to children who may be caught in a spiral of academic failure. At the very least, kinesthetic teaching throws a lifeline to kinesthetic learners, who often can\u2019t sit still and are seen as disruptive or learning disabled. Allowing these students to become leaders can strengthen the learning community of the whole class. By working together creatively\u2014constructing a tableau (a group body sculpture) or a piece of choreography, for example\u2014students acquire many skills they will need to be successful adults. They learn about communication and team- work, giving and taking, leading and following, taking risks, being accountable, and giving and receiving affirmation. They learn about their individual responsibility for a successful group effort, and the role the group must play in supporting the needs of individuals. This also helps build a genuine learning community, as students become invested in the process and the product. In short, people who create and perform together simply feel a stronger bond than individuals who sit in separate seats facing a teacher. 2 2 Susan Griss, \u201cThe Power of Movement in Teaching and Learning,\u201d Education Week, March 20, 2013, https:\/\/www.edweek.org\/tm\/articles\/2013\/03\/19\/fp_griss.html.

Little did they know that their desire to dine in one of Papa Choux\u2019s six booths would lead to a landmark civil rights case. After being seated at the table they had reserved, they were told that they needed to move from the semi-private booth because they were a lesbian couple. Johnson and Rol\u00f3n initially refused to give up their seats. When forced to leave, they took the names of everyone involved, and soon contacted attorney Gloria Allred. Allred, a well-known civil rights attorney, researched the merits of the case and agreed to sign on. The case was front-page news in Los Angeles for several weeks and became a media spectacle. Attorney Gloria Allred described the case in this way: \u201cThe first case that I can remember that I did was that Papa Choux case. Papa Choux was a fine dining restaurant in Los Angeles. My clients were an African American woman and her Latina partner. They were both businesswomen; made a reservation to celebrate Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday. And, in the Papa Choux restaurant, they had a special section for romantic dining. Patrons would walk up a few steps into a special section, which was a semicircle of booths with sheer curtains. Violinists would come by and play the violins; you could close the curtains and, you know, dine in semi-privacy and kiss or have your wine. They made a reserva- tion for the booths and were seated there at first, but then told by the man- ager that they could sit anywhere in the restaurant but there. And they were told one of the reasons was because it was for couples only. And they said, \u2018Well, what are we?\u2019 We\u2019re not chopped liver; we\u2019re a couple. Then they said that it was a house policy that no one could sit in that section unless they were a couple.\u201d 3 Papa Choux newspaper ad, June 24, 1983. \f",

The Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code sections 51 through 52, provides protection from discrimination by all business establishments in California, including housing and public accommodations: All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establish- ments of every kind whatsoever. 4 For more information on the California court system, visit http:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/2113.htm.

        "23": "23 Comprehension Practice Answer Key 1. What does it mean to \u201cfile\u201d a case? Submit or enter a document so it will be recorded correctly and with the proper authority. 2. What two laws did Allred use when filing the case? A city ordinance that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, specifically in housing, employment, and public accommodations, and the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 3. What was the purpose of the injunction? The purpose of the injunction was to stop the Papa Choux restaurant from discriminating against same-sex couples. 4. What reason does the first judge give for not ordering an injunction? The judge believed the case was too important and should be heard by a higher court. 5. Line 44: What is the double standard that Johnson refers to when speaking about the lower court? The judge suggested there might be a different way of applying the law to lesbians. 6. The case was on the front page of several newspapers. Why do you think this was front-page news in 1983? There are several possible answers to this question. One might be that gay rights were just coming to the forefront of people\u2019s consciousness. Another might be that both Allred and the Papa Choux restaurant publicized the case. Another might be that it was the first time the laws were tested. 7. What did the appellate court decide? The appellate court ruled that the Papa Choux restaurant could not discriminate against same-sex couples. Rol\u00f3n and Johnson won their case. 8. What impact did the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision have on the appellate court\u2019s ruling? Because the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case, the decision of the appellate court was the final decision. 9. The Papa Choux restaurant closed the booths and held a public wake for the death of romantic dining. What do you think their motivations were for doing this? There are several possible answers. They believed that romantic dining should be reserved for couples that consisted of one man and one woman. They garnered publicity by closing the booths. 10. Johnson compares their case to incidents in the segregated South. To what incidents might she be referring? Is this a fair comparison? Why or why not? Students should use examples from topics studied in class, including Rosa Parks refusing to sit at the back of the bus or segregated dining facilities. \f",

Translated from French, tableaux vivant[s] means \u2018living pictures.\u2019 The genre peaked in popularity between 1830 and 1920. During a performance of tableaux vivant[s], a cast of characters represented scenes from literature, art, history, or everyday life on a stage. After the curtain went up, the models remained silent and frozen for roughly thirty seconds. Particular emphasis was placed on staging, pose, costume, make-up, lighting, and the facial expression of the models. Sometimes a poem or music accompanied the scene, and often a large wooden frame outlined the perimeter of the stage, so as to reference the frame of a painted canvas. 5 Create a Tableau Directions 1. In collaborative groups, students choose one example of nonviolent and nonverbal protest from their Methods of Nonviolent and\/or Nonverbal Protest Organizer. 2. In class or outside of class, students research this protest. 3. Show students examples of tableaus and give them background on their use and purpose. Examples can be found at http:\/\/sites.psu.edu\/morethanaselfie\/tableau-vivant\/. 4. Students design a tableau based on their research. They can replicate a photograph or create a tableau from their own imagination. They can ask other classmates to participate in the tableau if they need more characters. Follow-Up Panel Discussion Directions 1. Students should be in collaborative groups of 4 to 5 people. 2. Give students all questions in advance. 3. Within their collaborative groups, students work to prepare answers to all questions and then practice answering the questions. 4. Acting as facilitator, ask each student two questions. Students will not know in advance which questions they will be asked. 5 Shannon Murphy, \u201cTableaux Vivant: History and Practice,\u201d Art Museum Teaching, December 6, 2012, https:\/\/artmuseumteaching.com\/2012\/12\/06\/tableaux-vivant-history-and-practice\/. \f",

Suggestions for adding excitement to the panel discussion: \u25cf Place a table at the front of the classroom and ask the students to sit at the table. As panel moderator, face the students. \u25cf Have a timer visible for the students on the panel. \u25cf Invite guests, such as school staff, parents\/family, or another class, into the classroom for the panel discussion. \u25cf Conduct the panel and tableau presentations in a different environment (e.g., a theater or large room). Suggested Discussion Questions Note: If students have kept a log of questions during the inquiry process, these questions can also be used as panel discussion questions. You may choose to ask other additional questions as well. 1. Can you tell the class the topic your group researched and briefly describe the historical event your tableau depicted? 2. Can you explain the meaning of your tableau and how your group decided on the idea that you presented? 3. Tell us about one of the participants in this protest. What role did this person play? What was the person\u2019s motivation? 4. How did your group choose this particular topic to research? (Provide a clear explanation.) 5. What primary and secondary sources did you use when doing your research? 6. What was the immediate result of this protest? 7. What were some of the long-term results of this protest? 8. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of this protest? 9. Can you connect the protest you studied to a current protest? If the protest you studied is a current protest, can you connect it to a protest in the past? 10.

In the late 1980s, I recorded a hundred interviews for a book I was writing about the LGBTQ civil rights move- ment, which we called the gay rights movement back then. After I finished the book, the cassette tapes sat in stor- age for almost 30 years\u2026 But then I dug them out, the New York Public Li- brary digitized them, and I took a lis- ten. Suddenly, I was back with all these people again\u2014at their dining room ta- bles, in their living rooms, sitting across from them and hearing about their lives\u2026 Now I get to share these amaz- ing stories with you. Individual stories that connect to the bigger story of American civil rights. Sylvia Rivera: Here, I\u2019m out there being a revolutionist for everybody else. I said now it\u2019s time to do my thing for my own people. Zandra Rol\u00f3n: [He] kept giving us the, you know, the back of the bus type of thing, you know.\u201cWell, you can sit over there. And you can sit over here and you\u2019ll have free drinks. But you will not, you cannot sit here.

I did what anyone else would do. I walked onto the stage and I took the podium away from John Lindsay. Perry Watkins: Things are gonna have to change drastically in this country. People are gonna have to wake up and realize, wait a minute, I am an average American citizen. Whether I\u2019m gay or lesbian or anything else, given that sim- ple fact alone, there is no way in hell I should have gone through what I went through in the military. Eric Marcus: Three decades ago, when I started researching and interviewing for my book, I was outraged that I\u2019d never heard these stories before\u2014 stories of accidental activists, commit- ted revolutionaries, and happy civil rights warriors, who gave me a greater understanding of who I am and where I\u2019m from. My hope is that by sharing these stories with you now, in a way that wasn\u2019t possible when I was a student, you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of how individuals\u2014people like you and me\u2014can challenge laws, institutions, and assumptions and come together to make big changes.

Over the course of two decades beginning in 1988, I conducted a hun- dred interviews with trailblazers from the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. Meet Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato. Deborah grew up in Los Angeles in what she described as a very \u201cupper-middle-class bourgeois black household \u2013 a very well-rooted, extremely well-connected family.\u201d Deborah called Zandra\u2019s family \u201ca Mexican commune.\u201d Zandra explained, jokingly, that she was related to three quarters of the population in Brownsville, Texas. Back in January 1983, they were a young couple on what was supposed to be a romantic date night. But when they faced discrimination over their dinner reservation, they refused to back down. Speaking to me in 1991, Zandra told me that she made the reservation for a special occasion. Z: At the time I was working on Satur- days. So this was the first weekend that we were gonna have a complete week- end together since we had gotten to- gether. It was also the year right before Martin Luther King\u2019s birthday was made into a holiday. And a friend of mine told me about this restaurant that was really nice. And the restaurant had these six booths on one side that were real romantic. And we got there and the, um, waiter kind of questioned us about,\u201cAre you sure you want the booths?\u201d And we told him, yes. And it\u2019s the type of booths Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Part I Transcript In this Give Voice to History Project archival audio oral history recorded in 1991, you will hear Deborah Johnson (\u201cD\u201d in the transcript), Zandra Rol\u00f3n (\u201cZ\u201d), and the interviewer, Eric Marcus (\u201cE\u201d). where you have to move the table out so that you can get in\u2014like a horse- shoe. And in the middle of the horse- shoe was like a fountain and there was a guy with a, a violinist who came around. And right in front of the table was a little white sheer curtain that closed. And candlelight. And it was just romantic. E: Did it occur to you that this might be a problem? Z: Not at all. I mean, to me, discrimi- nation never enters my mind first, ever. So they showed us to our table. We sit down. And we\u2019re taking our jackets off and this tall humongous guy comes by and... D: \u2026 and yanked the table away and told us, you know, you know,\u201cSo sorry, but you can't sit here. It\u2019s against the law to serve two men or two women in these booths.\u201d Z: We asked to see the manager. D: We were not going to move. Z: The guy that turned out to be the real ma\u00eetre \u2019d kept giving us the, you know, the back of the bus type of thing. \u201cWell, you can sit over there.

And, I mean, he looked at us like, you know, You can rot and freeze your ass over in hell. You know, we will serve you someplace else, but this section is for other kinds of people than you. Z: We left fuming and taking every- body\u2019s name, just fuming. I have never, ever, ever been denied blatantly anything because of who I was, ever. You know, I knew about, you know, the discrimination that went on. My grandfather... it was segregated and segregated meant white and others, you know. So I had heard about the dis- crimination that my grandfather had to go through. But never did it happen to me. And I had never been told that I couldn\u2019t do something or have some- thing or be somewhere or\u2026 because of who I was or the color of my skin. And I\u2026 How dare you! How dare you! E: So you walk out of there and you want to do what? Z: In the beginning when we left the restaurant we were both in agreement that we\u2019ve got to do something. D: But we decided that we were going to talk to Gloria Allred. Gloria Allred is a very famous civil rights attorney. My intention, when I went to the attor- ney, was just to get the restaurant to stop doing it, that\u2019s all. Having a public case was not our intent. It was a price that we had to pay. Z: Gloria Allred finally did the research and told us that we did have a case, that there was a law, a city ordinance that prohibited against discrimination on the basis of sex. D: But it was untested. Sexual prefer- ence. But it had been untested. And it basically was her call. Where essentially what she said was that it\u2019s a very grey matter of the law here. She says, but essentially what\u2019s more is the public consciousness-raising and benefit that could be done with this case, which was raise the issues, which wound up hap- pening, because it was an extremely public case. Z: They fought, they put ads in the paper saying basically... D: They kept taking ads out against us... Z: Saying,\u201cWe can go to jail, they can hang us by our thumbs, but we\u2019re not going to serve two men or two women.\u201d D: \u201cThis makes a mockery, a charade out of true romantic dining.\u201d Z: \u201cGloria Allred has gone too far in leading her own parade.\u201d Z and D: \u201cWe\u2019ll go to jail, we\u2019ll hang by our thumbs... but we will never serve two men or two women.\u201d E: This isn\u2019t the end of the story for Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato.

Now, with the Give Voice to History Project, I\u2019m bringing some of those trailblazers into your classrooms to help tell the story of this part of the American Civil Rights Movement. We\u2019re back with Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rol\u00f3n Amato. for the second part of their story of how they challenged discrimination after a Los Angeles restaurant refused to seat them in a romantic booth for two. D: When we filed, we filed under two laws. One was a local ordinance, which was a city ordinance that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, specifically in housing, employment, and public accommoda- tions. We also filed under the state Unruh Civil Rights Act. Unruh is the guy, Jesse Unruh, was the author of the bill. The Unruh Civil Rights Act pro- hibits discrimination on the basis of sex, creed, race, color, nationality, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it doesn\u2019t specifically say sexual orientation, so the courts have been interpreting that. So, we went to court, first time go- round, for an injunction. An injunction is basically to ask the restaurant not to do it anymore. The lower court said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to do that because we think it\u2019s an important issue and it should really go to trial. And if we issue that injunction the restaurant may be hurt, and, furthermore, we're not so sure, basically, that you have any rights as lesbians.\u201dYou know, because the lower court thought that there was a double standard in society. That\u2019s what he said, and that is what went on the paper\u2014that behavior that was okay for straight people in public was not okay for gay people and that the public might be offended by us. We were basically asking him to jump the gun to... Z: \u2026 and make a decision. D: Yes, stop the practice. You don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to go to court. Issue an injunction. Stop the practice now so that nobody else gets hurt. And he\u2019s saying,\u201cWell, I\u2019m not willing to jump the gun, because I re- ally don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. You should go to court. You should have a trial.\u201d We go to court, again, for what\u2019s called a motion of summary judgment, which is in lieu of a trial, which basi- cally says, you know, here are all the facts. Nobody disputes the facts, give us a ruling. He didn\u2019t want to touch it with a ten-foot pole either. Then it makes it to the appellate court. E: Every time there\u2019s a decision\u2026 Z: Major, major. We\u2019re in magazines, we\u2019re in every single newspaper. D: Los Angeles Magazine. Z: Los Angeles Times, the Valley. E: And every single time\u2026 Z: And front page! D: The appellate court basically over- turned the lower court decisions. The lower courts rule against us and the ap- pellate court rules for us, so they have a right to petition the Supreme Court, which they did. When the Supreme Court said they weren\u2019t going to hear it, then that meant that the next lowest 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 \f",
        "31": "31 level, the appellate court\u2019s ruling, was going to stand. There\u2019s like a four- or five-day window in between the appel- late court finding out that the Supreme Court is not going to hear and them following through with what they started to do in the first place. In that window, they closed down and had all of these ads and had this public wake, and everything else. So, it\u2019s like rather than serve us and comply with the law, they just closed the booths.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it at all.\u201d So they had a pub- lic wake, with the cameras from the 11 o\u2019clock news and the whole bit. Free drinks.\u201cTrue romantic dining died on this day.\u201d Ads out. Z: Yeah, it was terrible. D: And they closed it. Z: They, from the very beginning, put the boxing gloves on. Their intent was, we\u2019re going to fight you to the very end, which is what we ended up doing. E: So that was the end of the booths? Z: That was the end of the booths, that was the end of the booths. D: Well, yeah, because we went back, and then they issued the injunction and they issued the motion of sum- mary judgment. We won and they paid the attorney\u2019s fees and gave us our fine, 250 dollars a piece, which was the fine for the local (audience) ordinance. Z: They had to pay the attorney\u2019s fees, which was almost\u2026 D: Almost 30,000, almost 30,000 dol- lars. So they closed the booths. It\u2019s kind of like what they did in Mississippi and Alabama. You know. Instead of letting the black kids swim in the public pools, they just closed the pool. E: Right. Pull white kids out of the public school and start an academy... D: Yeah, that\u2019s what they did, they just closed it. E: Was it worth it? Z and D: Oh, yeah. Oh, hell yeah. E: Even though the owner of the Papa Choux restaurant simply carted his romantic booths to the curb, Deborah and Zandra\u2019s case put teeth into the local gay rights ordinance. While their case didn\u2019t actually change California\u2019s civil rights bill to add sexual orientation, the appellate court interpreted the law to include sexual orientation. Also, their high-profile court chal- lenge made national news and showed the impact of prejudice on ordinary citizens who were simply trying to live their lives. 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 \f",
